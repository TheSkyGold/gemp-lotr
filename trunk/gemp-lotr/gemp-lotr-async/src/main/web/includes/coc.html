<p>The Gemp-LotR sever is devoted to fans of Decipher’s Lord of the Rings Card Game. We want GEMP to be a place where
    everyone, regardless of who they are, can gather to socialize, talk, and play Lord of the Rings with like-minded
    people in a safe and welcoming environment. This is a family game and this is a family friendly server. In order
    to make that happen we have certain rules we ask all members of our community to adhere to. These rules will be
    vigorously enforced so that a handful of bad apples don't spoil it for everyone else.</p>
<h1>Don't Cheat</h1>
<p>Cheating includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Gold Farming</b> - Creating multiple accounts to abuse the merchant system to the benefit of primary account
        decreases the value of everyone’s my-card collections. Don’t do it.</li>
    <li><b>Collusion (Game Fixing)</b> - Soliciting or agreeing with an opponent to end any ranked match in any way
        other than playing it to conclusion detracts from the integrity of the league or tournament.</li>
    <li><b>Exploiting the Sever</b> - Knowingly utilizing a system error or card bug to your advantage.</li>
    <li><b>Multiple Accounts</b> - Entering a league or tournament with multiple accounts is not acceptable. If you have
        more than one family member using your network contact MarcinS. Otherwise a member with multiple accounts found
        entering a league or tournament will have those accounts deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Don't Be a Jerk</h1>
<p>This rule trumps any other. Any loophole you think you've found in any other rule is covered by this one. If you make
    our server a less pleasant place to be, we don't want you here and we have no problem revoking your account.
    Here are a couple of the things you should stay away from:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Flaming</b> - Calling people names, this includes calling others a troll.  Personal attacks are unacceptable.</li>
    <li><b>Rage Quitting</b> - Leaving a GEMP-LotR game without first hitting the concede button. It is found in the
        options tab of the chat window.</li>
    <li><b>Trolling</b> - Posting inflammatory, extraneous or off-topic messages with the primary intent of provoking
        readers into an emotional response or otherwise intentionally disrupting a game (even if that game is your own)</li>
    <li><b>Offensive language</b> - Please read what you wrote before you post it and think if anyone else could find
        it offensive, including but not limited to your standard 4-letter words. This also includes attacks against race,
        religion, culture, class, or sexuality.</li>
    <li><b>Rants</b> - You can disagree with whatever you like but using obscene language and/or a full CAPS chat
        is against our policies. We are sure you can find another way to voice your opinion without being aggressive,
        regardless of whom it is directed at.</li>
    <li><b>Ban Jumping</b> - If you create another account after being permanently banned, suspended or on probation,
        both of your accounts will be automatically banned.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find someone is violating one of these rules, report them to TLHH and let the moderators do their job.
    Responding to a troll or someone who may have flamed you will only get you in trouble. Report, ignore and move
    on the community at large will be better for it.</p>
<h1>Have Respect for Others</h1>
<p>Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but no one is entitled to attack others for sharing, or not sharing,
    that opinion. If you can't communicate without using combative, aggressive, or demeaning language, then please
    keep those comments to yourself, or be shown the door. Deliberately inflammatory remarks in game chat or the game
    hall; statements written with the sole intention of irritating people; attacks toward or inappropriate commentary
    regarding GEMP-LotR staff, creators, or other players  will limit or remove your GEMP-LotR privileges.</p>
<h1>Have Respect for the Site and its Content</h1>
<p>MarcinS and others have put a lot of work into the content on the site, and if you've just shown up to trample on
    that hard work, we will ask you to leave. Constructive criticism is welcomed; negativity for its own sake is not.
    Further, discussions instructing or otherwise advocating the circumvention of Code of Conduct will not be tolerated.</p>
<h1>Put Some Effort Into Your Communication</h1>
<p>A well-written comment engages your opponent and the rest of the game hall and facilitates discussion. We ask that
    while in game hall or game chat you avoid posting about or linking to the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pedophilia</li>
    <li>Pornography</li>
    <li>Sexist, Racist or Perverted Remarks</li>
</ul>
<h1>Penalties</h1>
<p><small>(Keep in mind, that banning a user takes us less time, than it takes you to create a new one.)</small></p>
<p>The penalty system is meant to provide guidance to users - it allows users to better understand the rules and adjust
    their conduct to conform to the expectations of the GEMP-LotR community which may differ from other Internet game
    sites. GEMP-LotR uses a strike system that grants you a maximum amount of 8 penalties to learn how to adhere to our
    server policies. Once a threshold has been broken, there is no way to gain strikes back. Here is the breakdown
    of all 8 stages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Up to 4 Warnings</b> - Warnings do not negatively impact your account but will stack against you for penalties.</li>
    <li><b>Probation</b> - This is your final warning. Once you receive probation, you are always on probation.
        All penalties after this will be suspensions.</li>
    <li><b>3-day Suspension</b> - You will be unable to log into  the site for three days.</li>
    <li><b>2-week Suspension</b> - You will be unable to log into for two weeks.</li>
    <li><b>Permanent Ban</b> - Your privilege to play Lord of the Rings on the site will be revoked permanently.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not enjoy banning people, but we will not hesitate to do so if we think that a person's removal will have
    an overall positive effect on the community. We also reserve the right to increase the punishment as we see fit,
    and any punishment above a warning will put the user at a minimum on the probationary level.</p>
<h1>Appeal System</h1>
<p>Moderators and staff are human and sometimes make mistakes. For this reason, we have an appeal system that members
    can utilize to plead their case in hopes of a reversal of a penalty. Once you have received a penalty, you may
    appeal your penalty via private e-mail. Discussion of penalties/conduct or ranting against a suspension on TLHH
    forums will not advance your appellant case. If you choose to use the appeal system, please make sure to check your
    spam folder for an email.</p>
<p>All appeals are normally seen within 48 hours of your appeal, except on weekends.</p>
