1. Introduce AbstractPermanent into Blueprint hierarchy.
2. Migrate Race (Orc, Elf, etc) into separate enum from Keyword.
3. Refactor Effect to return EffectResult upon playEffect, which will contain information about what actually
happened. Modify the Blueprints to have the "before" methods to take Effect parameter only and the "after" to
take the EffectResult parameter only. Effects which modify cards should take filters as parameters, use
overloaded constructor for single cards for backward compatibility, this constructor will call another constructor
with Filters.sameCard(...) filter.
4. Modify the Blueprint hierarchy to return possible return objects (PlayEventAction), TriggeredAction, etc. Use
final methods were possible to avoid implementation errors on new cards added.
