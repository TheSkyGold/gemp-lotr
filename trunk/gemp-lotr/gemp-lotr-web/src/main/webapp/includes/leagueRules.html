            <li>Each <b style="color:#009f9f">Serie</b> in <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> is played in an announced
                format (constructed or sealed).
                Most leagues will have the same format throughout the whole duration of it, but there is a chance of
                getting a mixed format <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>
                (for example, first week - FotR block, second week TTT block, etc). The format for each serie and/or
                league is announced at the beginning of the <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>.
            </li>
            <li><b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> starts at an announced date and lasts until specified number of <b
                    style="color:#009f9f">League series</b> are
                played out.

                is given the
                same amount and type of virtual product (boosters and/or fixed cards).
            </li>
            <li>(SEALED) Player who chooses to join a league after the first serie, is given a product that is a sum of
                all the
                virtual product he/she would have been given if he joined during a first serie up until the point in
                time he/she has chosen to join. This product WILL NOT contain any prizes given to participants of the
                <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b>.

        Deck building:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Each player builds a deck from the virtual product he/she owns.</li>
            <li>Deck in a <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> can be changed at any time. When you create or join a
                table with a deck, that
                deck is set at that point and any changes done to the deck afterwards, will not be reflected in the game
                on that table. If you wish to use a different deck for that game before it starts, leave and rejoin a
                table after modifying your deck.
            </li>
            <li>(SEALED) In case of Sealed format, only virtual product owned within that League can be used to build a
                deck.
            </li>
            <li>(SEALED) Virtual cards given out as prizes for that <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> are LEGAL for

            </li>
            <li>(SEALED) <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> has no X or R lists, so all cards are legal.</li>

            <li>Cheating includes, but is not limited to - entering <b style="color:#009f9f">League</b> with more than
                one account, knowingly
                exploiting a system or a card bug, game fixing (deciding the outcome of a rated game in other way than
                playing it out) with other players.

                environment, where

        F.A.Q.
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Can I trade cards in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                Cards in a Sealed League cannot be traded. The point of having a Sealed league is to provide players
                with limited (semi-random)
                access to card pool for building their deck. This, in theory, should give everyone fair chance of
                winning, based only on deck-building and play-skill.
            </li>
            <li><b>When will I get new boosters in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                New product in a Sealed league is given at the beginning of each Serie. At the moment this is not done
                automatically (requires me to actually run something) so it
                might be some time after each Serie starts or sometimes before a Serie starts, but each player receives
                new product at the same time.
            </li>
            <li><b>How do I join a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                You don't have to do anything special. While there is a League active, in your deck builder you'll find
                a drop-down to switch to Sealed league collection, just open
                a League pack you are presented with (left-click) and build your league deck.
