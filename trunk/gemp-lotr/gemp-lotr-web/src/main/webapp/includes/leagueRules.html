                on that table. If you wish to use a different deck for that game before it starts, leave and rejoin a
                table after modifying your deck.

        F.A.Q.
        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Can I trade cards in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                Cards in a Sealed League cannot be traded. The point of having a Sealed league is to provide players
                with limited (semi-random)
                access to card pool for building their deck. This, in theory, should give everyone fair chance of
                winning, based only on deck-building and play-skill.
            </li>
            <li><b>When will I get new boosters in a Sealed league?</b><br/>
                New product in a Sealed league is given at the beginning of each Serie. This is done automatically.
            </li>
            <li><b>How do I join a league?</b><br/>
                You don't have to do anything special. Just build a deck legal in the league and join/create table.
                In case of sealed league, you need to select the league collection in your deck builder
                (showing "All cards" by default) to build the deck. To open the packs you see there, just left-click
                them.
