twilight cost, instead of just making it cheaper to play.

<b>23 Sept. 2011</b>
- If an action or effect has play card from non-deck zone as an effect or a cost, you have to have a playable card of
type in that zone before you start playing the action or effect. If you use an action or effect of that type, you HAVE
to choose a matching card and play it if possible, but only from cards that were in that zone when you started playing
that action or effect. Examples - you can't use Morgul Gates without playable Nazgul in hand and you HAVE to play it,
you can't discard 3 cards using They Are Coming without an Orc in discard, if you have an Orc and use it, the Orc you
play MAY NOT be one of those you discarded as a cost.

<b>22 Sept. 2011</b>
- Changed the main page after logging in to give access to additional documents.
- Changed the play event animation so that player might actually recognize the card.
- The animations are no longer shown to the player who initiated the effect, he should know what he played.
- Fixed Athelas and some other possessions, that could not be used during Fellowship phase if a valid transfer target
could be spotted. The problem was, that in that case there are 2 (or more) possible actions to do with 1 card. Now
a small context menu will show up in that case and user will be able to choose, which action to perform.

<b>21 Sept. 2011</b>

- Fixing "Armor" to work only in Skirmish phase.
- Effective stats display.

than being treated like damage in Magic.
- Added concession (in 3rd tab in game) and real deck size is always used to sent to client, not the adventure deck
sometimes.
