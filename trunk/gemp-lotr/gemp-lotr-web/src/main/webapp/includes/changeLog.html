- Increased the time per game per player to 40 minutes, as 30 seems not enough.
- Added animated effect when card affects other card.
- Added animated effect when event is played from hand.
- If no cards in hand during reconcile, 8 cards have to be drawn.
- Fixing "Armor" to work only in Skirmish phase.
- Effective stats display.
- Fixing watchin game, where sometimes people where not able to watch a game.
- Fixing how Vitality is calculated. Wounds on a character affect the vitality of that character (lowering it), rather
than being treated like damage in Magic.
- Added concession (in 3rd tab in game) and real deck size is always used to sent to client, not the adventure deck
sometimes.
