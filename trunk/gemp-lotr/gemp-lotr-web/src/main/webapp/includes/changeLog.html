- If an action or effect has play card from non-deck zone as an effect or a cost, you have to have a playable card of
type in that zone before you start playing the action or effect. If you use an action or effect of that type, you HAVE
to choose a matching card and play it if possible, but only from cards that were in that zone when you started playing
that action or effect. Examples - you can't use Morgul Gates without playable Nazgul in hand and you HAVE to play it,
you can't discard 3 cards using They Are Coming without an Orc in discard, if you have an Orc and use it, the Orc you
play MAY NOT be one of those you discarded as a cost.

sometimes.
