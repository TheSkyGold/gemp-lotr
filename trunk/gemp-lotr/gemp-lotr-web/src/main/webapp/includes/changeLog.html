<b>6 Oct. 2011</b>

- Added filtering by block and new sets.

<b>5 Oct. 2011</b>
- Added timestamps to the chat messages in GameHall.
- Multiple cards played on a site in adventure path should be now layed out correctly - all should be visible, rather
than only the one played most recently, also the played cards will be placed "under" the site, rather than on top. Also
player tokens on the site will be put on top of the site and will not be obscured from view by the cards on top of the
site.
- Tables in Game Hall now also display the name of the format.
- Improved the speed of deck builder, also eliminated any problems with invalid deck statistics display.
- Split the culture buttons in deck builder into two bars, one for free people, one for shadow cultures.

<b>4 Oct. 2011</b>
- Added Deck Builder filtering in collection by set and card type. Also cards in deck builder collection are sorted
by name.
- Changed the rules system again.
- Most of the cards should now have animations when they affect other cards.
- Added cards from sets 02 and 03 ("Mines of Moria" and "Realm of the Elf Lords").
- I think I finally found and fixed the problem that caused the wounds not to be displayed sometimes on the client,
even though after page reload (F5) they were showing up.
- Added game manual.
- The "Card information" window will be bigger by default. In cases of most screen sizes it should be enough to see the
whole card without scrolling window.

- Saruman no longer can be assigned to skirmish.
- Adding clickable card names to game chat.

<b>26 Sept. 2011</b>

- Only the site where the fellowship currently is, has its text affecting game.
    
<b>24 Sept. 2011</b>
- Visually separated Free People and Shadow cards in deck builder.
- Game no longer freezes when FP overwhelms minions in skirmish.
- Effect that removes twilight (Glamdring, Sting etc) no longer fails to remove twilight, when the pool has less tokens
than the effect is trying to remove.

<b>23 Sept. 2011</b>
- If an action or effect has play card from non-deck zone as an effect or a cost, you have to have a playable card of
type in that zone before you start playing the action or effect. If you use an action or effect of that type, you HAVE
to choose a matching card and play it if possible, but only from cards that were in that zone when you started playing
that action or effect. Examples - you can't use Morgul Gates without playable Nazgul in hand and you HAVE to play it,
you can't discard 3 cards using They Are Coming without an Orc in discard, if you have an Orc and use it, the Orc you
play MAY NOT be one of those you discarded as a cost.

<b>22 Sept. 2011</b>
- Changed the main page after logging in to give access to additional documents.
- Changed the play event animation so that player might actually recognize the card.
- The animations are no longer shown to the player who initiated the effect, he should know what he played.
- Fixed Athelas and some other possessions, that could not be used during Fellowship phase if a valid transfer target
could be spotted. The problem was, that in that case there are 2 (or more) possible actions to do with 1 card. Now
a small context menu will show up in that case and user will be able to choose, which action to perform.

<b>21 Sept. 2011</b>
- Increased the time per game per player to 40 minutes, as 30 seems not enough.

- Fixing "Armor" to work only in Skirmish phase.
- Effective stats display.
- Fixing watchin game, where sometimes people where not able to watch a game.
- Fixing how Vitality is calculated. Wounds on a character affect the vitality of that character (lowering it), rather
than being treated like damage in Magic.
- Added concession (in 3rd tab in game) and real deck size is always used to sent to client, not the adventure deck
sometimes.
