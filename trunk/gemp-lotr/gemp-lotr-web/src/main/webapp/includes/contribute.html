<h1>How can I help?</h1>
<p>You can contribute in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you have a bit of time and have at least a bit of <b style="color:#009f9f">artistic talent</b> and <b
            style="color:#009f9f">computer graphics skill</b>,
        I currently need the following:
        <ol>
            <li>PNG icons of all cultures on transparent background with the height of exactly 16 pixels
                (width can vary) for the deck-builder filtering.
            </li>
            <li>Wound and burden tokens in PNG format on transparent background
                with dimensions of 100x100 (or so, doesn't have to be square dimensions).
            </li>
            <li>Players move tokens - same requirements as above for wound and burden tokens. Each token should have a
                player number on it (1, 2).
            </li>
            <li>Culture tokens - same requirements as above for wound and burden tokens. This is a low priority
                request.
            </li>
            <li>Icons in PNG format on transparent background that will be used on the game screen to show
                deck/hand/discard/dead pile counts. The number of cards in each will be written on top of the image.
            </li>
            <li>Modify the existing images for the cards in the sets that are already implemented and have an errata
                issued, to reflect the errata.
            </li>
            <li>Any other graphics you think might improve the look of the user interface.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>I need help with <b style="color:#009f9f">hosting of the server</b> (at the moment I use my home PC and host it
        from home). If I don't
        find any, I will have to set it up on Amazon EC2 which is quite expensive ($300 per year or so). If you can help
        out with hosting of the server, here are the requirements:
        <ol>
            <li>Apache-Tomcat 6+ or any other Java Web Server</li>
            <li>MySQL database</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        If you know how to <b style="color:#009f9f">program in Java</b> and have at least a bit of experience, you can
        help out with
        implementation of the card sets. About 95% of cards in a set is just a matter of a few easy lines of code. The
        only problem is, that this also takes a huge amount of time. Consider a small set with 120 cards, each card
        taking 5 minutes to implement (easy - right?), it's still 10 hours.<br/>
        If you wish to help out with that, I promise I will do the more difficult cards (like Return to Its Master).
    </li>
    <li>If you enjoy playing LotR and have <b style="color:#009f9f">plenty of free time</b>, you may just test and
        report the problems.
    </li>
    <li>Donations? Well I do spend a lot of time working on it, but I love (almost) every moment of doing it. If I will
        have to host it on Amazon I might really use some financial support though...
    </li>
