<h1>How can I help?</h1>
<p>You can contribute in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you enjoy playing LotR and have <b style="color:#009f9f">plenty of free time</b>, you may just test and
        report the problems.
    </li>
    <li>Donations? Well I do spend a lot of time working on it, but I love (almost) every moment of doing it. I'm
        hosting the server on Amazon so I might use some financial support. If you wish you can send donations to my
        PayPal account - marcins78@gmail.com
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to help out, you can contact me on <a href="mailto:marcins78@gmail.com">marcins78@gmail.com</a> to
    discuss.</p>
